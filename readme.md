# Awesome Longevity Information [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Up-to-date and curated list with information related to health-span extension. 
>
> As we do not have unlimited time on this planet yet, only [information transmitted in an optimal form]((contributing.md)) should become part of this list.
> 
> We should avoid overlapping content unless it comes in a different format (audio-only, video, writing). For example, both [this article](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-09/si-cdd090920.php) and the [original research that it draws upon](http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/34/19-20/1330) are helpful to understand Metformin's mechanism of action, but in this case, I would make a subjective call and only add the article to this list.
> 
> Short-term objective: someone going through the information from this list should improve his understanding of aging and become able to devise an actual program to increase his health-span.
> 
> Long-term objective: As Richard Feynman would have put it, we're trying to understand aging and how to solve it "in terms of the smallest set of principles."

## Audiobooks

If a book is available in both audio and written form, add only the audiobook to this list unless it is too technical and, therefore, hard to follow.
If we’re doing this right, books should be of last resort because summarized content is preferred. Many of us already have enough university textbooks to read.

## Other

Be open-minded in this category. Example: maybe, in the future, a VR game could teach us how to act in life threatening situations.
