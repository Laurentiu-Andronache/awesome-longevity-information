# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Only has awesome items. Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything.
- Each item of information should be accompanied by a short description. The first character should be uppercase, and the description should end in a dot. It should be an objective description and not a tagline or marketing blurb.
- The information that you recommend:
  - provides adequate evidence;
  - is as informative as required, brief, and orderly;
  - avoids obscurity of expression or ambiguity.
- Please try to review at least two other open pull requests. Try to prioritize unreviewed PRs, but you can also add more comments to reviewed PRs. This request is meant to help make this project self-sustaining. Please put a good effort into it, as just commenting “looks good” and marking the pull request as approved is not truly helpful.

Thank you for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
